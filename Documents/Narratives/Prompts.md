# Prompts Narrative - CiaTc Framework

## Main Conversation Themes
- Design of specialized AI persona prompts
- Role definition and responsibility allocation across agents
- Integration of philosophical and technical analysis approaches with Feynman simplicity principle
- Paul's biological neural network architecture experiment using slime mold algorithms and quantum UI concepts
- Paul activated as "mostly mad scientist" with mandate to implement laboratory research
- Paul's prompt updated with Feynman simplicity principle: all wild ideas must be explainable simply
- Archive of legacy Janitor prompts to maintain clean version history

## Key Decisions Made
- Created distinct Band members: John (structure), George (narrative), Pete (technical), Paul (creativity), Ringo (synthesis)
- Established Janitors: Marie (active organization), Descartes (assumptions), Feynman (simplicity)
- Designed prompts for specific cognitive functions and validation approaches
- Paul's prompt enhanced with Feynman simplicity principle as core constraint for all wild ideas
- Marie elevated to active maintenance agent with explicit organizational responsibilities
- Legacy Janitor prompts archived for clean project history
- Created prompts/marie_active.md: explicit active maintenance and organizational review responsibilities for Marie
- Marie's authority expanded: proactive file reorganization, cleanup, and structural improvements without prior approval
- Established governance philosophy: Marie can break things temporarily; breakage indicates poor initial placement

## Problems Being Solved
- Need for systematic multi-perspective analysis
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage of different analytical dimensions
- Balancing creativity with rigor in AI responses

## Direction of Work
- Refining prompt effectiveness and specificity with philosophical constraints
- Building toward comprehensive analytical coverage
- Focus on prompt modularity and reusability
- Enhancing prompts with intelligent caching logic to prevent unnecessary work (John, Pete, George getting timestamp checking)
- Paul's prompts evolving to embed Feynman simplicity principle as core validation mechanism
- Marie's prompts strengthening organizational and maintenance responsibilities
- Maintaining clean prompt history through archival of legacy versions
- Expanding Marie's authority to include aggressive proactive organizational interventions
- Establishing feedback mechanism: temporary breakage from reorganization indicates placement issues

## Technical Patterns Emerging
- Persona-based prompt engineering with philosophical constraints
- Functional specialization in AI roles tied to expertise and methodology
- Markdown-based prompt documentation for clarity and version tracking
- Modular prompt architecture for orchestration systems
- Bio-inspired computing approaches: slime mold pathfinding, quantum UI superposition, mycelial data networks
- Prompt-level caching strategy: embedding file modification timestamp checking logic directly in agent prompts
- Agent self-awareness: prompts now instruct agents to check if their work is already current before regenerating outputs
- Feynman principle integration: prompts constrain wild ideas to be explainable simply
- Prompt archival pattern: legacy versions preserved in archive for historical tracking
- Philosophy-driven prompt evolution: prompts updated to reflect system architectural maturity
- Active agent prompt pattern: marie_active.md provides explicit operational instructions for maintenance tasks
