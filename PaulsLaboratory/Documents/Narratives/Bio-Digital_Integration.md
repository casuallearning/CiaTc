# Bio-Digital Integration Narrative

## Main Conversation Themes
- Biological systems as inspiration for digital architecture
- Slime mold pathfinding algorithms for UI navigation
- Circadian rhythms governing app behavior
- Mycelial networks for data sharing

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) as core decision engine
- Integration of HealthKit biometric data for biological feedback
- WASM compilation for performance-critical bio-algorithms

## Problems Being Solved
- Traditional UIs ignore human biological rhythms
- Static interfaces don't adapt to user context
- Artificial decision trees vs natural optimization

## Direction of Work
- Moving toward true bio-digital symbiosis
- Creating living, breathing digital organisms
- Implementing natural selection in software architecture

## Technical Patterns Emerging
- WebAssembly for biological algorithm compilation
- HealthKit integration for biometric feedback loops
- Metal Performance Shaders for parallel bio-simulations
- Core ML for circadian pattern recognition
