Review what Opus just did.

Begin by reviewing the file index and the directory mapping.

Identify in 3 bullet points:
• Files that are not properly organized in the folder structure
• Unnecessary complexity that doesn't "spark joy"
• Specific files or code to remove

Be kind but direct.
Focus on what can be tidied.
